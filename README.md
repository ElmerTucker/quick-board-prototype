# quick-board-prototype

The intent of quick-board-prototype is to have a set of quickly iterable core files to allow for rapid prototyping of game ideas. 

## Goals
- Files will be kept in standard formats such as .MD, .CSV, etc
- .gitIgnore will include images by default to prevent repo bloat; but enable if needed
- Include some design prompts and templates
- Ideally compatible with a variety of 'card builder' tools, though this needs to be tested
  - Card Creator for Steam
  - CardMaker for Windows
  - [ ] investigate some of the online tools for quick generation
  - Tabletop Simulator
